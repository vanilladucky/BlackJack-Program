This is a project that I have endeavoured to create. 
It is a project based on the game of BlackJack and this program aims to utilise the methods of Basic Strategy and Card Counting. 
I have utilized OOP in Python extensively to create different but very clearly defined classes for each of the groups that are needed in the game of blackjack
